# osxplaypause.app

I use a
[Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000](http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000). The
keyboard has a play/pause media key that only works with
iTunes. Luckily the Microsoft drivers allow me to reassign the key to
launch an application.

This application does one thing: it triggers the play/pause key that
is found on Apple keyboards.
